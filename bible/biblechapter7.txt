Building a very large tower

"yo wait so dawn, who'd you give that child to?" dawnclaudius asked.

"idk lol some random person in assyria lol." dawnclaw replied.

"oh ok cool." dawnclaudius replied.


MEANWHILE IN ASSYRIA


"yo so like, wouldn't it be cool if we could like build some stairs up to the void and meet dawnclaw because we missed the last meetup in Araḫ Kislimu." said the king of babylandia.

"what, why are you talking to a wall dad?" said the kings son (aka the son of dawnclaudius and dawnclaw but shh (: )

"listen i can do what i want i'm fucking king ok." replied the king.

"oh ok then." replied his son.

"cool so i'll go get everyone and we'll start building the large tower." said the king.

"cool." replied his son.

the king of babylandia traveled across all the lands except america because that didn't exist yet. he told everyone that he was going to build a very tall and long and hard tower and that everyone should
meet him at the center of babylandia to help him build the tower to dawnclaw's house.

everybody gathered in babylandia, with a lot of wood to build the tower.

"ok everybody we gonna build a very large tower it's going to be huge." said the king in a loud voice so that everybody could hear him.

"cool that sounds fun." said the king of rome.

"i hope dawnclaw autographs my 200 chapter fanfiction of her and my oc, dlawcawn." said the king of greece.

"nice i really need to get more of dawnclaudius's fur for my collection because he's my favorite character." said the king of gothlandia.

"alright you guys are really weird but let's just start building this tower already." said the king of babylandia.

everyone started to build the tower, stacking each wood ontop of another and then nailing them together. they eventually couldn't stack any more wood from the ground, so they started building stairs widthin
the tower and climbing those and gradually getting higher and higher.

"yo dawnclaudius, did you hear that the homo sapiens are building a long tower all the way up to the void." dawnclaw said to dawnclaudius.

"WAIT WHAT!? they're building up right into my computer server!" dawnclaudius said in a loud voice.

"lol just move it dawnclaudius." dawnclaw replied.

"NO I CAN'T BECAUSE I BOLTED IT DOWN!" dawnclaudius screamed.

"you have magical powers just let them destroy it and make another one what do you even have on there anyway lol." replied dawnclaw.

"NO IT'S FILLED WITH 200 TB OF MY PORN AND I CAN'T LET THE FUCKING HOMO SAPIENS DESTROY ALL OF IT!" dawnclaudius screamed.

"god damnit why do you have 200 terabytes of porn dawnclaudius? who needs that much fucking porn?" replied dawnclaw.

"LISTEN DAWN DON'T JUDGE ME I'M GOING TO STOP THESE FUCKERS FROM DESTROYING MY 100 CENTURYS WORTH OF PORN!" screamed dawnclaudius.

"you're weird." dawnclaw replied.

"hmm, i wonder how i should stop them. i know! i'll make them speak different languages so that they don't know how to talk to eachother." thought dawnclaudius.

dawnclaudius put a curse on all the people while they were sleeping.


THE NEXT MORNING


"šulmu ṣeḫer u rabi!" said the king of babylandia

"expecto, quid?" replied the king of rome, confused by what the king of babylandia had said.

"Οὐ ξυνίημι. τί συνέβηκα?" said the king of greece.

"𐌱𐌹𐌳𐌾𐌰 𐌸𐌿𐌺, 𐍂𐍉𐌳𐌾𐌰𐌹𐍃 𐍃𐌰𐌹𐌽𐌹𐌶𐍉." said the king of gothlandia, not understanding what was going on.

"DAWNCLAUDIUS WHAT DID YOU DO?" dawnclaw screamed at dawnclaudius.

"lol i made all of them speak other languages." dawnclaudius replied.

"oh ok." dawnclaw replied.

"lol prank'd." said dawnclaudius.
